## Why stocks are not as risky as they sound

When most beginners think of stocks, they imagine _gambling_. In reality, owning shares of a business is very different from buying a lottery ticket.

Over long periods, broad stock market indices like NIFTY 50 have historically grown faster than fixed deposits and gold. The key variables are:

- **Time horizon**: the longer you stay invested, the lower the impact of short-term volatility.
- **Diversification**: owning a basket of stocks instead of betting on one company.
- **Discipline**: investing regularly instead of trying to time every market move.

## How the Indian stock market actually works

At a basic level, you interact with three players:

1. **Stock exchanges** like NSE and BSE where shares are traded.
2. **Depositories** (NSDL, CDSL) that hold your shares in demat form.
3. **Brokers** (like Zerodha, Groww, Upstox) that provide the trading platform.

You open:

- A **trading account** with a broker to place buy/sell orders.
- A **demat account** with a depository participant to hold your shares.

Once that is done, you can start with small amounts and gradually build confidence.

## A simple 3-step starting plan

1. **Define your goals** – e.g. "I want to invest for 10+ years for wealth creation."
2. **Pick broad-based instruments first** – like index funds or blue-chip stocks.
3. **Automate contributions** – use SIPs or a fixed monthly investing calendar.

You do **not** need to predict where NIFTY will be next month. You only need a robust, repeatable process.
